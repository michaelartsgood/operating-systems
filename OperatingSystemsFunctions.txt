One type of user interface that is most common with consumer products is a graphical user interface or GUI 
(contrasted with a command-line interface). This interface allows the user to interact with electronic devices 
such as personal computers, smart phones, etc., through graphic icons and audio. Here, the user manages the interface 
through direct manipulation of them; e.g., opening and closing windows and applications, as opposed to being required 
to type in lines of commands. 

Virtual memory is a form of memory management in an operating system. It works by temporarily transferring data from random access 
memory (finite memory storage which can run out)) to disk storage, and it does this by using both hardware and software to allow 
a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages.
