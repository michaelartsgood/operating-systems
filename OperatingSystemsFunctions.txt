One type of user interface that is most common with consumer products is a graphical user interface or GUI 
(contrasted with a command-line interface). This interface allows the user to interact with electronic devices 
such as personal computers, smart phones, etc., through graphic icons and audio. Here, the user manages the interface 
through direct manipulation of them; e.g., opening and closing windows and applications, as opposed to being required 
to type in lines of commands.
